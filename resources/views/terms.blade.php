            but not limited to real estate or other tangible property, which shall have
            economic value, for sale or rent, as applicable. The sellers shall
            advertise their properties for sale, whereas, the buyer shall get a list of
            properties to make their choice to buy. If the buyer and seller can fix
            their terms and conditions of intended sale transaction, they will contact
            with the solicitors to finalise the deal. It is hereby understood by both
            the Seller and the Buyer that under any circumstances and for the purpose
            of the respective law in force of the country, we are not acting on behalf

            in this Website according to your requirement.

        <p style="color: #0a0807">
            If the seller agrees to list their property for sale or rent, the seller
            will have to pay a listing fee payable on advertisement. The fee will be
            determined by us on time to time and shall be communicated to you through
            this Website or shall be provided with a notice at the time of posting for
            advertisement or described in the price chart. This statement hereby
            acknowledges and confirms that once the property has been made live or if
            the ownership of the property you are listing cannot be verified the fees
            are not refundable. The property is advertised until sold/leased or can be
            withdrawn by you at anytime but if you choose to withdraw your property no
            refunds are permitted.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #0a0807">
            The seller acknowledges that by signing up and listing their property they
            authorise Oz Property Market Pty Ltd to advertise their property for sale
            or rent. If you acknowledge and accept the terms and conditions of our
            website and a package is paid for on our system, you must provide ownership
            details as requested by Oz Property Market, if your ownership cannot be
            verified in the form of a council rates notice or we cannot prove the
            existence of the property you have listed then no refunds will be given.
            You have to be the legal owner of the property or be able to act on behalf
            of the legal owner (via signing an authority form provided by us after
            signing up) to list a property. There will be no refunds provided if either
            of these items cannot be met. After the advertisement has been made live,
            if the seller wishes to withdraw the
            listing for a certain period of time, they are eligible to do so for a
            maximum of 60 days. Within the 60 days time the seller can choose to relist
            whenever he/she wishes. After the 60 days has been reached, the relevant
            package to the listing will need to be purchased again due to the
            advertisement returning as a “new” listing once published.At the time of
            posting the advertisement, few factors need to be considered including but
            are not limited to property price, property area, property location, and
            property type etc.

            property but does charge a one off fee for providing marketing services. In
            the absence of a signature the client specifically authorises Oz Property
            Market Ltd to advertise their property by confirming and paying for
            services prior to listing.
