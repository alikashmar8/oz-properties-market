                    2018 customer survey</a>
                we’re proud to report:

                – 86% received the price they expected when selling their own user; and

                – 82% sold their user within their expected time frame.

                We believe all Australians can sell their own user. Why? Because no one knows your user like you – the
                owner.

                If you join us at buyMyplace, we’ll list you on the same user portals as agents, such as
                Realestate.com.au and Domain.com.au. Plus, we provide you with the same quality marketing materials as
                an agent. The only difference is that 100% of your sale price goes back in your pockets, not an agent’s!

                We would love to help you sell privately and we have no issue with you being listed with an agent.
                However, we highly recommend re-reading the fine print on your ‘Agency Agreement’ to ensure you won’t be
                in breach of the contract you signed with you agent. The same goes for renting your user privately.

                If you’d like to list your user with us plus an agent, go for gold. However, we recommend you enter into
                a ‘Non-Exclusive Agents Authority’ with your agent so that if you end up selling your user yourself
                through buyMyplace you’ll get to pocket 100% of your sale price, instead of paying your agent
                commission. The same applies if you're renting your user privately.

                Each state in Australia has different laws and regulations about beginning a tenancy.

                This might be certain information that you must provide to the tenants before signing the lease, user
                condition reports and where to pay or lodge the bond payment. It is very important that you are familiar
                with your obligations as a landlord as you may be liable for fines or legal action if you do not comply.

                Most states in Australia provide standard format leases for private landlords to use.

                While the overall aggregate selling period ranges from 4 – 6 weeks, there are many factors that can
                influence selling time. Factors include the location of your user; the features of your user; the wants
                and availability of potential buyers; the strength of the market; and the price you set for your user.

                On average, our customers sell their properties 24 days faster if they choose our

                    Finding the right price for your home</a>
                is essential when it comes to selling your user because you need to find the perfect balance. Too much,
                and it can languish for months on the market; and too little might see you missing out on money.

                Landing on the right price is all about being knowledgeable about your local market and there are plenty
                of easy, accessible ways to do your research. A great place to start is searching for recently Sold
                properties on Realestate.com.au and Domain.com.au to find out how much properties similar to yours have
                sold for in your area. You can also see how long properties were listed on the market.

                If you join us at buyMyplace, you’ll have access to the valuation service we use, which is powered by
                Core Logic-RP Data – the same subscription-based service used by traditional agents.

                On average, we suggest giving yourself at least a 2-week lead time from purchasing your campaign to
                going live on the market.

                This will allow time for cleaning &amp; organising your home, arranging professional photography,
                posting your For Sale Board, planning your Open for Inspections and giving your conveyancer time to get
                your Contracts of Sale prepared.
